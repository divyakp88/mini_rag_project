      "text": "the basis for machine safety (see figure on pages 6, 7). The machine manufacturer starts with a risk analysis, minimizes identified risks, and finally determines whether an adequate level of safety is present. If the answer is negative, risk reduction measures must be implemented and quantified in terms of effectiveness. Let’s take a look at some basic terms defined in ISO 12100, which provides a general description of the risk assessment process: Basic conditions cDangerous electrical voltage cHot surface cKeep hands clear cRisk of entrapment cEntanglement rotating parts cCutting hazard cHead injury hazard Hazards: Potential sources of harm Hazardous situation: Situation in which a person is exposed to at least one hazard. The resulting harm can be immediate or occur over time. Risk: Results from a hazard and is assessed by combining the likelihood of the occurrence of harm and the severity of consequence. 6 Machine safety | Towards safe machinery: Risk assessment Globally, and almost without exception, statutory guidelines for the design and operation of machines mandate a risk assessment to identify potential hazards, minimize risks, and comply with applicable health and safety requirements. The process helps determine the type and quality of preventive measures or safeguards. Risk assessment • Must be performed by machine manufacturer; results remain with the manufacturer • Must account for both proper use and any foreseeable misuse of the machine• Provides an important body of proof for the manufacturer for liability claims in accident cases Identify limits of machineryStart EndIdentify hazards Estimate risk E.g. guards and safety functionE.g. inherent safety User information at machine and in manualDesign-related safety measures Safe machine?

      "text": "the use of the necessary protective measures. 3rd stage: Indicated other dangers Reduce risk through notification / hazard warning of residual risk If the hazards cannot be prevented or sufficiently limited by means of design measures (step 1), safeguards must be provided in step 2 by means of safety-related parts of control systems (SRP/CS). These must be designed and selected so that the probability of functional errors is sufficiently low. If this is not possible, any faults that occur must not lead to the loss of the safety function. In addition to the safeguards of the machine designer, the machine operator or user may require additional protective measures for reducing the residual risk (e.g. personal protective equipment, training etc.).Functional safety During its entire life cycle – from manufacture to disassembling – a machine poses danger to man, machine and the environment. It is therefore necessary to identify these dangers already when the machine is designed and reduce them by means of suitable measures. The EU Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC stipulates that a machine should not pose any danger. However, as there is no 100% safety in engineering, the aim is to reduce these dangers to a tolerable level of residual risk by means of risk reduction measures. The overall safety of a machine defines the state in which it can be considered as being free of unwarranted risks to persons or as free of danger. The functional safety is part of the overall safety of a system which depends on the correct functioning of the safety- related systems, other technology, safety-related systems and external risk reduction facilities. Reducing the risk of a machine The international standard EN ISO 12100 “Safety of machinery – Basic concepts, general principles for design” provides the design engineer with detailed assistance in the identification of hazards",
