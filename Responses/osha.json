There are few formal program requirements for Alliances and the agreements do not include anenforcement component. However, OSHA and theparticipating organizations must define, implement,and meet a set of short- and long-term goals that fallinto three categories: training and education; outreachand communication; and promotion of the nationaldialogue on workplace safety and health. OSHA T raining and Education OSHA area offices offer a variety of information serv- ices, such as compliance assistance, technical advice,publications, audiovisual aids and speakers for specialengagements. OSHA’s Training Institute in ArlingtonHeights, IL, provides basic and advanced courses insafety and health for Federal and state complianceofficers, state consultants, Federal agency personnel,and private sector employers, employees, and theirrepresentatives. The OSHA Training Institute also has established OSHA Training Institute Education Centers to addressthe increased demand for its courses from the privatesector and from other federal agencies. These centersare nonprofit colleges, universities, and other organi-zations that have been selected after a competition forparticipation in the program. OSHA also provides funds to nonprofit organiza- tions, through grants, to conduct workplace trainingand education in subjects where OSHA believes thereis a lack of workplace training. Grants are awarded annually. Grant recipients are expected to contribute20 percent of the total grant cost. For more information on grants, training, and edu- cation, contact the OSHA Training Institute, Office ofTraining and Education, 2020 South Arlington Road,Arlington Heights, IL 60005, (847) 297-4810, or seeOutreach on OSHA’s website at www.osha.gov. For further information on any OSHA program, contactyour nearest OSHA regional office listed at the end ofthis publication.

OSHA also offers a variety of programs and initiatives to help employers comply with theagency’s standards or guidelines, as discussed inthe following paragraphs.Appendix C: Sources of OSHA Assistance Safety and Health Program Management Guidelines A single free copy of the guidelines can be obtained from the OSHA Publications Office, P.O.Box 37535, Washington, DC 20013-7535 bysending a self-addressed label with your request orby calling (202) 219-4667. The guidelines are alsoavailable on OSHA’s web site at http://www.osha.gov/under Federal Register Notices. State Programs Many states have their own OSHA-approved safety and health regulations covering workplacesin their jurisdiction. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 encourages states to develop and operate their own job safety and health plans.States with plans approved under section 18(b) ofthe OSH Act must adopt standards and enforce requirements that are at least as effective as federalrequirements. There are currently 25 state plan states: 23 covering private and public (state and local govern-ment) sectors and two covering public sector only.Plan states must adopt standards comparable to thefederal within 6 months of a federal standard’spromulgation. Until such time as a state standard ispromulgated, Federal OSHA provides interimenforcement assistance, as appropriate, in thesestates. A listing of the state plan states appears on the Home Page at http://www.osha.gov/under Office Directory ; an explanation appears under Programs and Services. See also the enclosed list of States with Approved Plans at the end of this appendix. Consultation Program Another way OSHA helps employers, especially small employers, is through its consultation pro-gram. Free onsite safety and health consultationservices are available to employers in all states whowant help in establishing and maintaining a safeand healthful workplace.

What Standards Cover Woodworking? OSHA has specific standards covering wood- working equipment plus other general regulationsthat address hazards common to woodworkingfacilities. This publication primarily covers theregulations for woodworking equipment. A list ofthe general OSHA regulations covering hazardscommon to woodworking facilities is included inAppendix A. Standards for Woodworking Machinery •General Requirements for All Machines, 29 CFR 1910.212 •Woodworking Machinery Requirements, 29 CFR 1910.213 •Mechanical Power Transmission Apparatus, 29 CFR 1910.219 •Standard for the Prevention of Fires and Explosions in Wood Processing andWoodworking Facilities, NFPA 644-1993 • Woodworking Machinery—Safety Requirements, ANSI O1.1-1992 For a detailed list of other OSHA standards that may apply to the woodworking industry, seeAppendix A. Indroduction A Guide for Protecting Workers from Woodworking Hazards2 In this document, “shall” and “must” are used to indicate when a control device or other safeguard isrequired by OSHA; “should” is used to indicaterecommended safe work practices. What Are the Main Types of Hazards Associated with WoodworkingOperations? The principal hazards of woodworking can be classified as either safety or health hazards. Safety hazards can cause immediate injury to a worker. For example, if not properly grounded, the metalframework of a circular saw could become ener-gized and possibly electrocute an employee. Or, if aworker’s hands were to contact a saw blade, he orshe could have one or more fingers cut off. Safety Hazards • Machine hazards – Point of operation– Rotary and reciprocating movements– In-running nip points (pinch points) • Kickbacks• Flying chips, material• Tool projection• Fire and explosion hazards• Electrical hazards Health Hazards • Noise• Vibration• Wood dust—carcinogens• Chemical hazards—from exposure to coatings, finishings, adhesives, solvent vapors This manual primarily focuses on machine guarding (safety) and wood dust (health) hazardsand their controls; however, all of",
