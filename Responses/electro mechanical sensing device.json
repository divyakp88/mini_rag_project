      "text": "does not have to operate a guard) In addition, operators and others alike are protected. Against what hazards does electro-sensitive protective equipment not protect? Since an electro-sensitive protective equipment does not rep- resent a physical barrier, it is not able to protect people against emissions such as ejected machine parts, workpieces or chips; ionizing radiation; heat (thermal radiation); noise; sprayed coolant and lubricant; etc. Similarly, ESPE cannot be used on machines on which long stopping/run-down times require mini- mum distances that cannot be achieved. In such cases, guards must be used.ESPE technologies Electro-sensitive protective equipment can implement detec - tion of persons through various principles: optical, capacitive, ultrasound, microwaves and passive infrared detection. In practice, optical protective devices have been proven effec - tive over many years and in large numbers. Optoelectronic protective devices The most common electro-sensitive protective devices are optoelectronic devices such as: •Safety light curtains and photoelectric switches (AOPD: ac - tive optoelectronic protective device) •Safety laser scanners (AOPDDR: active optoelectronic pro - tective device responsive to diffuse reflection) •Camera-based protective devices (VBPD: vision based pro-tective devices) Examples of optoelectronic protective devices An optoelectronic protective device can be used if the op - erator is not exposed to any danger of injury due to ejected parts (e.g., splashes of molten material). GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice § 1 2 3 cSafeguarding (technical protective measures) Risk reduction 3-28Safety light curtains and photoelectric switches (AOPDs) AOPDs are protective devices that use optoelectronic transmis - sion and reception elements to detect persons in a defined two-dimensional area. A series of parallel light beams (normally infrared) transmitted from the sender to the receiver form a protective field that safeguards the hazard zone. Detection occurs when an opaque object fully interrupts one or more beams.",

      "text": "the sensing f ield is broken, the machine stops and will not cycle. This device must be used only on machines that can be stopped before the worker can reach the danger area. The design and placement of the guard depends upon the time it takes to stop the mechanism and the speed at which the person’s hand can reach across the distance from the guard to the danger zone. SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Environment, Safety & Health Division Machine and Portable Tools | Machine Safeguarding Guideline 19 July 2021 SLAC -I-730-0A21T -016-R003 5 of 12 2.2.1.1 Electromechanical Sensing Device An e lectromechanical presence- sensing device has a probe or contact bar that descends to a predetermined distance when the operator initiates the machine cycle. If there is an obstruction preventing it from descending its full pre -determined distance, the control unit does not actuate the machine cycle. 2.2.2 Pullback A pullback utilizes a series of cables attached to the operator’s hands, wrists, or arms which withdraws hands when the slide/ram begins to descend. It is primarily used on machines with full -revolution stroking action and allows access to the point of operation when the slide/ram is up.
