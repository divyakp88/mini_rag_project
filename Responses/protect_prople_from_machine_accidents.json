      "text": "to ProtectEmployees from Equipment Hazards? •Use appropriate equipment for the job . Workers can be seriously injured if they do notuse the correct equipment for a job. Use ma-chines only for work within the rated capacityspecified by the machine manufacturer. Use thecorrect tools on a given machine. For example,when using a circular saw, use the correct bladefor the required cutting action. Similarly, youmust only mount blades, cutter heads, or collarson machine arbors that have been accuratelysized and shaped to fit these parts. •Train workers on machine use and allow only trained and authorized workers to operateand maintain the equipment . Workers should understand the purpose and function of allcontrols on the machine, should know how tostop the equipment in an emergency, and shouldbe trained on the safety procedures for specialset-ups. Operator training should include hazards associ- ated with the machine, how the safeguards protectthe worker from these hazards, under what circum-stances the guard may be removed (usually just formaintenance), and what to do if the guard isdamaged or not functioning properly. Employees should be able to demonstrate their ability to run the machine with all safetyprecautions and mechanisms in place. •Frequently inspect equipment and guards. Ensure that: (1) the operator and machine areequipped with the safety accessories suitable forthe hazards of the job, (2) the machine andsafety equipment are in proper working condi-tion, and (3) the machine operator is properlytrained. Document the inspections and keep therecords. Documentation should identify themachine, inspection date, problems noted, andcorrective action taken. Noting problems helpsto ensure that corrective action will be taken,that operators on all shifts will be made aware ofany potential danger, and that any pattern of repeat problems on a particular machine can bedetected and resolved as early as possible. •Use equipment only when guards are in place and in working order .",

They cover the selection of safeguarding methods. They apply to machine and shop custodians. 2 Guidelines If a machine- specific evaluation or other inspection reveals areas of the machine whose moving parts pose a potential hazard to operators or others near by, guarding can be accomplished by one or a combination of the methods below.1 Whichever safeguard or combination of safeguards is chosen, it must 1. Prevent the worker’s body or clothing from contacting hazardous moving parts 2. Be firmly secured to machine an d not easily removed 3. Not allow falling objects to enter moving parts 4. Create no new hazards (must not have shear points, jagged edges or unfinished surfaces) 5. Create no interference (must not prevent worker from performing the job quickly and comfortably) 6. Allow safe lubrication (the person should be able to lubricate the machine without removing the safeguard) 1 Content based on Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Concepts and Techniques of Machine Safeguarding ( OSHA Publication 3067 ) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Health and Safety Manual , Chapter 25, “Machine Guarding - Shop and Lab Machine Safety” SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Environment, Safety & Health Division Machine and Portable Tools | Machine Safeguarding Guideline 19 July 2021 SLAC -I-730-0A21T -016-R003 2 of 12 2.1 Guards 2.1.1 Fixed A fixed guard provides a barrier, a permanent part of the machine, preferable to all other types of guards. 2.1.2 Interlocked When an interlocked guard is opened or",
